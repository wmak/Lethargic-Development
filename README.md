Lethargic-Development
=====================
## Running the project (Assuming you have pip installed and a Ubuntu-like Environment)
_For the first run_

1. "pip install Django==1.5.4"
- "sudo apt-get install libpq-dev"
- "sudo pip install psycopg2"
- "cd CMSReScheduler"
- "python manage.py runserver"

_For future runs_
- "python manape.py runserver"
Now the CMSReScheduler will be running on your local environment on port 8000
